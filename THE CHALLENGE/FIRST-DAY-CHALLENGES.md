## Probleme 01: LINUX 

Move the file named Sharing-is-caring to the directory tmp/ITC



## Probleme 02 : CRYPTOGRAPHY

It can be really simple, when you dont overthink... 
and go back to the rot of the problem ... 
can you decrypt the following ? 

vgpSYNT{s6e0g_02rc0_9er_6zc5e29a2}



## Probleme 03: LINKED LIST

Given the Sorted Linked list head which contain duplicates, the task is
to delete all the duplicate and make linked list such that every element
appear just one time.

Example:

```
Original Linked list : 1 1 2 2 3
Answer : 1 2 3
```


## Probleme 04 : ARRAYS

 Problem - Merge two sorted arrays without using extra space
Since, extra space should not be used, use the input arrays itself to perform this task
 For example: 
 
 ```
 
 If the input array is, 
                                a = [0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8]
                                b = [1 , 3 , 5 , 7]
 The output arrays should be,
                                a = [0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4]
                                b = [5 , 6 , 7 , 8]
```

 Sample Input - 1
 ```
                                a = [5 , 8 , 9 , 10]
                                b = [1 , 2 , 100]
```

Sample Output - 1

```
                                a = [1 , 2 , 5 , 8]  
                                b = [9 , 10 , 100]

```

## Probleme 05: DIVIDE AND CONQUOR

Given 𝑛 points on a plane, find the smallest distance between a pair of two (different) points. 

Recall

```
the distance between points (𝑥1, 𝑦1) and (𝑥2, 𝑦2) is equal to √︀((𝑥1 − 𝑥2)² + (𝑦1 − 𝑦2)²)
```

## Problem 06: SEARCH ALGORITHMS

Linear Search is one of the easiest searching algorithm. The main aim of a searching algorithm is to search for a desired element in the whole array. Linear Search sequentially searches for an element in an array.

algorithm :
```
In Linear Search, we start from the 0th index of the array, we compare each element with the key (desired element).
If the key is same as the element of array ,we return the index of that element.
If the key does not match any element then ,we return -1.

```

implement it algoriithm 

## Problem 07: STRINGS


Read a string, S and print its integer value. If S cannot be converted to 
an integer, print Bad String.

## Problem 08: DATABASE-SQL

Create a database and then create tables and insert data in, then alter these tables and update values.

## Problem 09: WEB 

Connect to Database Using Javascript

## Problem 10: WEB/MOB DEV 

Can you create a Weather API application ? 






**GOOD LUCK** 🚀
